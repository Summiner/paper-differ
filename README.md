# Paper Patch Differ

This program that is meant to be ran on every time a commit is pushed to Paper makes it so we can see what changed in the minecraft server code on every commit.

To use this on the latest commit of Paper, just run it 
```bash
paper-differ
```

If you'd like to do the initial run, do it like this;
```bash
paper-differ --initial true
```
