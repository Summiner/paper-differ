# Paper Patch Differ

This program is meant to be ran every time a commit is pushed to Paper. It allows us to see what changed in the minecraft server code with each commit.

To use this on the latest Paper commit, run:
```bash
paper-differ
```

If you would also like to initialize the project, run:
```bash
paper-differ --initial true
```
